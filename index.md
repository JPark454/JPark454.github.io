Welcome to my personal website!

I'm currently on an exciting academic journey, pursuing a Bachelor of Data Science and Decisions at UNSW, with an anticipated graduation in 2025. Accompanied with my studies, I'm passionate about helping others grasp the intricacies of Mathematics and Economics as a tutor, and I also enjoy the dynamic environment of working as a waiter.
